            <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
            <p>Smart agriculture significantly reduces environmental impact by minimizing resource wastage and pollution. Through precision farming techniques, such as targeted application of water, fertilizers, and pesticides, it reduces runoff and leaching, preventing contamination of soil and water bodies. </p>
            <p>Additionally, by optimizing resource use and minimizing chemical inputs, smart agriculture mitigates soil degradation and reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with agricultural activities. Overall, these practices promote more sustainable farming methods that protect ecosystems, conserve natural resources, and contribute to environmental stewardship.</p>
